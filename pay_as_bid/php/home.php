<h2>Bidding into a </h2>

<p>
    Each person gets a wind turbine which can produce at either 5, 10 or 15 MW in each hour at a marginal cost of between 5-15&#36;&#47;MWh.
    The bids are given before this uncertainty is revealed, and subsequently remunerated based on the actual production.
    Any demand not met will be handled by a large oil plant with a marginal cost of 100&#36;&#47;MWh.
</p>

<p>
Your objective is as always to maximize your profits from selling the wind production of your wind turbine.
