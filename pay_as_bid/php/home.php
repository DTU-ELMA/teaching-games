<h2>Bidding into a pay-as-bid market</h2>

<p>
    Each team gets a wind turbine which can produce at a marginal cost of 0&#36;&#47;MWh.
    A bid consists only of a cost for the turbine's production, in compliance with regulations that stipulate that all available wind production must be used.
    In real time, each wind turbine will generate 5, 10 or 15 MWh, with each possibility being equally likely.
</p>

<p>
    In case the total wind production is not enough to cope with demand, any residual demand will be handled by a large oil plant with a marginal cost of 100&#36;&#47;MWh.
    The demand for each hour is projected to be such that there is a 10% chance that the oil plant will be activated.
    For the remaining 90% of the time, a wind plant will be the marginal producer.
</p>

<p>
    The market is pay-as-bid.
    This means that your revenue is equal to <i>your bidded price</i> times your scheduled production, regardless of the marginal producer's bid.
    If you bid at 0&#36;&#47;MWh, you will earn nothing, even if you are scheduled.
    On the other hand, if you bid too high a price, then you may not get scheduled, and will not gain anything either.
</p>

<p>
     Your objective is to maximize your profits from selling the wind production of your wind turbine.
     The team who has made the most money at the end of 5 bidding rounds will win a price.
